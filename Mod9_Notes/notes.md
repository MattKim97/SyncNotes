### React Notes

## Parent -> Child flow
    - We usually pass data down to children(props)  and pass events up to parent from child

## State

    - Want to hold data in state, also when updating through forms do not want to alter the state of the previous objects, create a new object and set it to new object using setState method 

## HTTP with React + Fetch

    - Async await for fetching
    - dont name ur delete function delete js delte exists use doDelete
    - React state is data. Almost 100% of the time, that data comes from an external source
    -  useEffect sideeffect, dependancy array only rerender when we change whatever is array iuf empty on renders once
    - put our http fetches in there since we don't know when we get them back
