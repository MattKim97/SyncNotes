Covering Docker, Containers , Imagers, and MySQL

DOCKER

    a platform for building shipping and running applications in a consistent manner
    provides the dependencies that an application needs
    docker compose up -> automatically updated and downloaded everything in the container
    good thing about docker can immediately remove all things related to the container
    no need to uninstall everything after using the application

CONTAINERS

    standardized containers are used in-order to keep everything in a standardized and isolated environment
    make sure everything works across different computers
    containers keep everything isolated from our own underlying systems

VMs vs Containers

    virtual machines are basically virtualizing a OS basically allowing multiple OS to run on one computer

    -problems with VM
        - each BM needs a full-blown OS
        - very slow to start
        - very very very resource intensive

    - benefits of containers
        - needs less hardware resources
        - allows running of multiple applications in isolation
        - start quickly
        - use the host machines OS - no need to download multiple OS


We basically use docker as a server in this course --- don't go much further than that
